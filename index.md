I am an economics and electrical engineering student at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2:
	This lab holds a special place in my heart because it was our first time creating code that can be verified with a test. In this instance, we established what a singular noun, plural noun, and present tense verb were. By doing so, the user on would be tasked with inputting the aforementioned parts of a sentence before being read a short paragraph utilizing their chosen words. I thoroughly enjoyed this one because it also caused the least heartache when it came to compiling. 

Lab 3:
	I had made a couple of breakthroughs in this lab thanks to my partner. Here, I understood ‘cout’ and ‘cin’statements and their proper usage. In the previous lab, I realized I had some gaps in the knowledge. This lab remains my favorite one because I had no idea what the equations were to calculate the difference in days. Frankly, I did not even know they existed. So, this remains my favorite lesson in all the labs, but that is not at all a slight against the curriculum, it merely sparked the greatest lightbulb of curiosity in my head!

Lab 6:
	Who doesn’t love a good game of blackjack? While I might be a veteran of the game, I was a complete novice when it came to building a functioning game of blackjack. As a gamer, I found this lab to be particularly interesting, because unlike madlibs or playing a guessing game, this one felt closer to video games, albeit an extremely simple version. I had the most fun in this one!
